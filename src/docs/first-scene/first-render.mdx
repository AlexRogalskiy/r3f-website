title: Creating our first cube
---

Let's create our first cube using `react-three-fiber`.
The first thing we need to do is import `Canvas` from `react-three-fiber` and we need to wrap the parent of the 3D scene with it.

You can also just wrap the whole app like so:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "react-three-fiber";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Canvas>
    <Scene />
  </Canvas>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

We are all set up to create our scene component and in there add our first cube.

To make show any type of object in our scene we need to create a mesh, and that consists of:

- A geometry, in this case our cube but it can be any geometry from [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxBufferGeometry) or even a custom model you made in blender or any other software.
- A material, this tells the mesh how this object will be filled. In our case we will just add a simple color that reacts to light.

We can now create a these components and wrap them in a mesh like so:

```jsx
function Scene() {
  return (
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry attach="geometry" args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="#6be092" />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

We have a geometry but it has two issues, it's black and it looks like it's 2D as we can only see one side of it.

Let's rotate it a bit just so we can see it better:

```jsx
function Scene() {
  return (
    <mesh rotation={[0, 10, 0]}>
      <boxGeometry attach="geometry" args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color={"#6be092"} />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```
