The best way to get started with React Three fiber is by installing with using npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using Yarn:
yarn add react-three-fiber three

# Using NPM:
npm i react-three-fiber three
```

You can also use a good old script tag if you want:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-three-fiber@4.2.10/web.cjs.js"></script>
```
