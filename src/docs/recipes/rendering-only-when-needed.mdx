title: Rendering only when needed
---

By default it renders like a game loop 60fps. Switch on `invalidateFrameloop` to activate loop invalidation. Now it will render on demand when it detects prop changes.

```jsx
<Canvas invalidateFrameloop ... />
```

Sometimes you want to render single frames manually, for instance when you're dealing with async stuff or camera controls:

```jsx
const { invalidate } = useThree();
const texture = useMemo(() => loader.load(url, invalidate), [url]);
```
