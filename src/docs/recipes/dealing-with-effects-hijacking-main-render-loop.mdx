title: Dealing with effects (hijacking main render-loop)
---

Managing effects can get quite complex normally. Drop the component below into a scene and you have a live effect. Remove it and everything is as it was without any re-configuration.

```jsx
import { extend, Canvas, useFrame, useThree } from 'react-three-fiber'
import { EffectComposer } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/EffectComposer'
import { RenderPass } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/RenderPass'
import { GlitchPass } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/GlitchPass'
extend({ EffectComposer, RenderPass, GlitchPass })

function Effects() {
  const { gl, scene, camera, size } = useThree()
  const composer = useRef()
  useEffect(() => void composer.current.setSize(size.width, size.height), [size])
  useFrame(() => composer.current.render(), 1)
  return (
    <effectComposer ref={composer} args={[gl]}>
      <renderPass attachArray="passes" args={[scene, camera]} />
      <glitchPass attachArray="passes" renderToScreen />
```
