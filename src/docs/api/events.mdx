title: Events
---

Threejs objects that implement their own `raycast` method (meshes, lines, etc) can be interacted with by declaring events on them. We support pointer events, clicks and wheel-scroll. Events contain the browser event as well as the Threejs event data (object, point, distance, etc). You need to [polyfill](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) them yourself, if that's a concern.

Additionally, there's a special `onUpdate` that is called every time the object gets fresh props, which is good for things like `self => (self.verticesNeedUpdate = true)`.

Also notice the `onPointerMissed` on the canvas element, which fires on clicks that haven't hit any meshes.

```jsx
<mesh
  onClick={(e) => console.log("click")}
  onWheel={(e) => console.log("wheel spins")}
  onPointerUp={(e) => console.log("up")}
  onPointerDown={(e) => console.log("down")}
  onPointerOver={(e) => console.log("over")}
  onPointerOut={(e) => console.log("out")}
  onPointerEnter={(e) => console.log("enter")}
  onPointerLeave={(e) => console.log("leave")}
  onPointerMove={(e) => console.log("move")}
  onUpdate={(self) => console.log("props have been updated")}
/>
```

#### Event data

```jsx
({
  ...DomEvent                   // All the original event data
  ...ThreeEvent                 // All of Three's intersection data
  intersections: Intersect[]    // All intersections
  object: Object3D              // The object that was actually hit
  eventObject: Object3D         // The object that registered the event
  unprojectedPoint: Vector3     // Camera-unprojected point
  ray: Ray                      // The ray that was used to strike the object
  camera: Camera                // The camera that was used in the raycaster
  sourceEvent: DomEvent         // A reference to the host event
  delta: number                 // Initial-click delta
}) => ...
```

#### Propagation and capturing

```jsx
  onPointerDown={e => {
    // Only the mesh closest to the camera will be processed
    e.stopPropagation()
    // You may optionally capture the target
    e.target.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)
  }}
  onPointerUp={e => {
    e.stopPropagation()
    // Optionally release capture
    e.target.releasePointerCapture(e.pointerId)
  }}
```
