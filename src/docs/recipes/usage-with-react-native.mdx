title: Usage with React Native
---

You can use `react-three-fiber` to build universal (native and web) apps via Expo's WebGL package ([expo-gl](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/gl-view/)).

> ðŸ’¡ **Bootstrap**: `npx create-react-native-app -t with-react-three-fiber`

Be sure to use a physical iOS or Android device for testing because the simulator can have issues running graphics heavy apps.

### Manual setup

```bash
# Install the Expo CLI

npm i -g expo-cli

# Create a new project

expo init myapp
cd myapp

# Install packages

yarn add expo-gl expo-three three@latest react-three-fiber@beta

# Start the project

yarn start
```
