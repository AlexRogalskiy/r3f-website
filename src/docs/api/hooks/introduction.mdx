title: Hooks

Hooks can only be used **inside** the Canvas element because they rely on context! You cannot expect something like this to work:

```jsx
function App() {
  const { size } = useThree() // This will just crash
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <mesh>
```

Do this instead:

```jsx
function SomeComponent() {
  const { size } = useThree()
  return <mesh />
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <SomeComponent />
```
