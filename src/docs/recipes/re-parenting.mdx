We support [portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html). You can use them to teleport a piece of the view into another container. Click [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/three-fibre-useFrame-test-fojbq) for a small demo.

```jsx
import { createPortal } from 'react-three-fiber'

function Component() {
  // "target" can be a three object, like a group, etc
  return createPortal(<mesh />, target)
```
