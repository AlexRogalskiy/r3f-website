title: useFrame
---

```jsx
useFrame((callback: (state, delta) => void), (renderPriority: number = 0));
```

This hook calls you back every frame, which is good for running effects, updating controls, etc. You receive the state (same as useThree) and a clock delta. If you supply a render priority greater than zero it will switch off automatic rendering entirely, you can then control rendering yourself. If you have multiple frames with a render priority then they are ordered highest priority last, similar to the web's z-index. Frames are managed, three-fiber will remove them automatically when the component that holds them is unmounted.

Updating controls:

```jsx
import { useFrame } from "react-three-fiber";

const controls = useRef();
useFrame((state) => controls.current.update());
return <orbitControls ref={controls} />;
```

Taking over the render-loop:

```jsx
useFrame(({ gl, scene, camera }) => gl.render(scene, camera), 1);
```
