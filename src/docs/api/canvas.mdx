title: Canvas
---

The `Canvas` object is your portal into Threejs. It renders Threejs elements, _not DOM elements_! Here is a small hello-world that you can try out:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "react-three-fiber";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <sphereBufferGeometry attach="geometry" />
      <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="hotpink" />
    </mesh>
  </Canvas>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The canvas stretches to 100% of the next relative/absolute parent-container. Make sure your canvas is given space to show contents!

```jsx
<Canvas
  children                      // Either a function child (which receives state) or regular children
  gl                            // Props that go into the default webGL-renderer
  camera                        // Props that go into the default camera
  raycaster                     // Props that go into the default raycaster
  shadowMap                     // Props that go into gl.shadowMap, can also be set true for PCFsoft
  colorManagement = false       // Auto sRGBEncoding encoding for all colors and textures + ACESFilmic
  vr = false                    // Switches renderer to VR mode, then uses gl.setAnimationLoop
  gl2 = false                   // Enables webgl2
  concurrent = false            // Enables React concurrent mode
  resize = undefined            // Resize config, see react-use-measure's options
  orthographic = false          // Creates an orthographic camera if true
  noEvents = false              // Switch off raytracing and event support
  pixelRatio = undefined        // You could provide window.devicePixelRatio if you like
  invalidateFrameloop = false   // When true it only renders on changes, when false it's a game loop
  updateDefaultCamera = true    // Adjusts default camera on size changes
  onCreated                     // Callback when vdom is ready (you can block first render via promise)
  onPointerMissed />            // Response for pointer clicks that have missed a target
```

You can give it additional properties like style and className, which will be added to the container (a div) that holds the dom-canvas element.

### Defaults that the canvas component sets up

Canvas will create a _translucent WebGL-renderer_ with the following properties: `antialias, alpha, setClearAlpha(0)`

A default _perspective camera_: `fov: 75, near: 0.1, far: 1000, z: 5, lookAt: [0,0,0]`

A default _orthographic camera_ if Canvas.orthographic is true: `near: 0.1, far: 1000, z: 5, lookAt: [0,0,0]`

A default _shadowMap_ if Canvas.shadowMap is true: `type: PCFSoftShadowMap`

A default _scene_ (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a _raycaster_.

A _wrapping container_ with a [resize observer](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-measure): `scroll: true, debounce: { scroll: 50, resize: 0 }`

You do not have to use any of these objects, look under "Recipes" down below if you want to bring your own.
