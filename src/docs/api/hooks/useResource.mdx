title: useResource
---

```jsx
useResource((optionalRef = undefined));
```

Take advantage of React's `useRef` with the added consideration of rendering when a component is available (e.g. in the next frame). Useful when you want to share and re-use resources across components.

```jsx
import { useResource } from 'react-three-fiber'

const [ref, material] = useResource()
return (
  <meshBasicMaterial ref={ref} />
  {material && (
    <mesh material={material} />
    <mesh material={material} />
    <mesh material={material} />
  )}
)
```
